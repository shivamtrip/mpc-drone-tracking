In this project I implemented Model Predictive Control to enable a drone (blue) to track a moving subject (yellow) while avoiding a moving obstacle (red) using Potential Field Theory. 
Additional constraints involved tracking the subject from a specified relative angle while maintaining a desired range from subject.
